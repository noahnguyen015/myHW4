Two uses of inheritance in a program is the ability to have take a function from one class and be able to use it for another class. 
If a child class inherits a function from the parent class, it can use it as it's own function. It helps with reducing repeated code.

Another use of inheritance is to be able to alter and change a function from another class. Child classes can alter inherited functions
to do something different from the original. You can have the same function definition for different classes.
